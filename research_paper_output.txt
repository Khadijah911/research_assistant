 Literature Review

Transformational leadership has gained substantial attention in various sectors due to its potential to enhance organizational performance and employee satisfaction. In Nigeria, this leadership style is particularly relevant in educational institutions, where it is instrumental in driving change and improving academic outcomes. According to Money [1], transformational leadership in Nigerian secondary schools, led by principals, has demonstrated effectiveness in fostering a positive educational environment. This leadership approach encourages a culture of innovation and commitment, which is vital in the context of rapidly evolving educational demands.

Further evidence of the impact of transformational leadership can be seen in the performance of universities across Nigeria. Abubakar and Ahmed [2] explored its effects from a strategic management perspective, revealing that transformational leadership significantly boosts institutional performance. This leadership style fosters an environment where academic staff feel empowered and motivated to excel, thus contributing to overall institutional effectiveness. Such outcomes underscore the potential of transformational leadership to become a cornerstone of strategic management in Nigerian higher education.

In a broader organizational context, Ejere and Abasilim [3] found that transformational leadership has a robust positive impact on organizational performance in Nigeria. This leadership style, characterized by inspiring and motivating followers, enhances organizational commitment and productivity, distinguishing itself from transactional leadership approaches. The findings suggest that the adoption of transformational leadership strategies can lead to substantial improvements in organizational outcomes, aligning with global trends observed in other sectors and regions.

While the focus has been primarily on educational contexts, the implications of transformational leadership extend to other areas within Africa. Kets de Vries and Sexton [5] discuss the broader spectrum of leadership in Africa, emphasizing the critical role of transformational leadership amidst challenges such as political instability and economic uncertainty. This perspective highlights the transformative power of such leadership in shaping a more resilient and adaptive workforce, capable of navigating complex socio-economic landscapes. This aligns with Leonard and Grobler's [6] findings on the challenges faced by transformational leaders in communicating employment equity during organizational changes in South Africa, further illustrating the multifaceted applications and challenges of this leadership style across the continent.
